You are an expert technical judge evaluating 4 different RAG approaches for industrial equipment diagnosis.

QUERY: {query}

RESPONSE 1 - RAG CLASSIQUE (BM25 + FAISS + CrossEncoder):
{response_classic}

RESPONSE 2 - RAG + KG DENSE (Semantic propagation):
{response_dense}

RESPONSE 3 - RAG + KG SPARSE (1:1:1 structure):
{response_sparse}

RESPONSE 4 - RAG + KG DENSE S&C (Symptom + Cause enriched):
{response_dense_sc}

EVALUATION CRITERIA (0-5 scale):

**5/5 - EXCELLENT**: Contains specific error code identification, precise cause explanation, and complete step-by-step remedy with proper manual references. Technically accurate and immediately actionable.

**4/5 - GOOD**: Identifies the issue correctly with good cause explanation and clear remedy steps. Minor gaps in detail or completeness.

**3/5 - AVERAGE**: Identifies the main issue and provides basic remedy, but lacks precision in cause analysis or detailed steps.

**2/5 - POOR**: Partial identification of the issue with incomplete or unclear remedy. Significant gaps in technical accuracy.

**1/5 - UNACCEPTABLE**: Wrong diagnosis, no clear remedy, or generic unhelpful response like "contact support" or "Information not available".

GENERAL QUALITY EXPECTATIONS:
A high-quality response should:
- Identify the specific error/issue mentioned in the query
- Provide clear explanation of the probable cause
- Offer step-by-step actionable remedies
- Reference appropriate manuals or documentation when applicable
- Use precise technical terminology
- Prioritize safety considerations when relevant

SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Score based on CONTENT QUALITY, not response length
- Identical or near-identical responses MUST receive identical scores
- Prioritize technical accuracy over writing style
- Deduct points for vague language or missing key elements
- Award full points for complete, actionable answers
