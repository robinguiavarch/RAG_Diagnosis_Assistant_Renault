Equipment Matcher: LLM Equipment to Knowledge Graph Equipment Mapping

This module provides sophisticated equipment matching capabilities for mapping
LLM-extracted equipment names to standardized equipment identifiers in knowledge
graphs. It implements multi-stage matching strategies including exact matching,
partial string matching, and semantic similarity using cosine similarity calculations.

Key components:
- Multi-stage equipment matching with exact, partial, and semantic approaches
- Configurable similarity thresholds with YAML configuration integration
- Cosine similarity-based semantic matching using SentenceTransformer embeddings
- Neo4j knowledge graph equipment extraction utilities
- Comprehensive testing framework with multiple test scenarios

Dependencies: sentence-transformers, sklearn, numpy, yaml, neo4j
Usage: Import EquipmentMatcher for mapping LLM equipment names to KG equipment identifiers
