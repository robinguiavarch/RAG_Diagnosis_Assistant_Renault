ACAL-142 Robot is not calibrated Gd(:%) Cause: The robot group has not been
calibrated. Remedy: Please run signature calibration of before running program
motions. 3–27 ERROR CODES MARRBERCD 04121 E REV N ACAL-143 Not enough
orientation. Cause: Not enough orientation to solve for the TCP Remedy: Please
touch up some positions to include larger orientation of the 3.1.2 APSH Alarm
Code APSH-000 %s Cause: General status messages. Remedy: None APSH-001 %s
missing Cause: A MACRO was called without a parameter that must be entered.
Remedy: Check the MACRO call in the TP program. Remedy: Please run signature
calibration of before running program motions. The parameter has the wrong data
type. Remedy: Check the MACRO call in the TP program. APSH-003 %s Illegal zone
number Cause: An zone number less that 1 or greater than $IZONEIO.$NO_ZONES was
used. Remedy: Use an event number from 1 to $IZONEIO.$NO_ZONES. APSH-004 Waiting

has not been given permission to enter by the cell controller. 3–28 MARRBERCD
04121 E REV N ERROR CODES Remedy: If the cell controller does not give control
of an interferance zone to the robot when it should, check the cell con troll
ers' interferance zone program ming. APSH-005 Entering interf. zone %s Cause:
The robot has received permission to enter the interferance zone. Remedy: Used
to clear the waiting for interferance zone message only. APSH-006 PERM memory is
low Cause: This warning indic tates that the amount of free memory in the CMOS
memory partition has gotten dangerously low. If the PERM memory runs out, you
will experience strange MEMO errors and possibly robot lock-ups or register
dumps. Remedy: Warning only. Delete any unneeded data. Contact your FANUC
representative with this error. You will probably have to adjust the memory
configuration in your robot controller. APSH-007 TEMP DRAM memory is low Cause:
This warning indic ates that the amount of free memory in the TEMP memory
partition has gotten dangerously low. If the TEMP memory runs out, you will
experience strange MEMO errors and possibly robot lock-ups or register dumps.
Remedy: Warning only. Delete any unneeded data. Contact your FANUC
representative with this error. You will probably have to adjust the memory
configuration in your robot controller. APSH-008 FAULT must be reset Cause: A
fault has ocurred, so the operation request ed cannot be per formed.

specified special move position. This could have occur red if a new position was
re corded in one of the special move programs when the robot was not master ed
or calibrated, causing an uninitialized position to be created. Executing a
specific operation afterwards might cause this alarm to occur. Remedy: Ensure
the robot is master ed and calibrated. Re-teach the position in the special move
