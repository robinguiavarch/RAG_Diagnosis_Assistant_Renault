• Know whether or not you are using an intrinsically safe teach pendant if you
are working in a hazardous environment. • Before teaching, visually inspect the
robot and work envelope to make sure that no potentially hazardous conditions
exist. The work envelope is the area defined by the maximum motion range of the
robot. These include tooling attached to the wrist flange that extends this
range. xiii Safety MARRBERCD 04121 E REV N Staying Safe While Teaching or
Manually Operating the Robot Advise all personnel who must teach the robot or
otherwise manually operate the robot to observe the following rules: • Never
wear watches, rings, neckties, scarves, or loose clothing that could get caught
in moving machinery. Immediately report unsafe working conditions to the
supervisor or safety department. • FANUC America Corporation recommends that no
one enter the work envelope of a robot that is on, except for robot teaching
operations. However, if you must enter the work envelope, be sure all safeguards
are in place, check the teach pendant DEADMAN switch for proper operation, and
place the robot in teach mode. Take the teach pendant with you, turn it on, and
be prepared to release the DEADMAN switch. Only the person with the teach
pendant should be in the work envelope. Warning Never bypass, strap, or
otherwise deactivate a safety device, such as a limit switch, for any
operational convenience. Deactivating a safety device is known to have result ed
in serious injury and death. • Know the path that can be used to escape from a
moving robot; make sure the escape path is never blocked. • Isolate the robot
from all remote control signals that can cause motion while data is being
taught. • Test any program being run for the first time in the following manner:
Warning Stay outside the robot work envelope whenever a program is being run.
Failure to do so can result in injury. — Using a low motion speed, single step
the program for at least one full cycle. — Using a low motion speed, test run
the program continuously for at least one full cycle. — Using the programmed
speed, test run the program continuously for at least one full cycle. • Make
sure all personnel are outside the work envelope before running production.

with the macro. SPOT-049 Coll. Guard Reg. Data Error Cause: The data con tai ned
in the Collision Guard macro register is not an integer or is not in the range
of 1 to 200. Remedy: Enter the correct data into the Collision Guard macro
register. Verify that the payload settings are accurate and do not exceed the
capacity of the mechanical unit. Remedy: In the teach pendant program, check the
equalization pressure spot welding instruction EP= value. Note: The small est
valve pressure allowed is For digital weld con troll ers, the largest pressure
number allowed depends on the width of the Equalization Pressure group output.
If this GOUT is 4 I/O points wide, then the maximum pressure is If the GOUT is 5
